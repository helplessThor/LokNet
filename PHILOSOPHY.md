# Philosophy

LokNet is a Chromium-based browser distribution focused on openness, resilience, and user control.

It does not attempt to replace Chromium, but to ensure that access to the web remains possible even under restrictive or unstable global conditions.

## Core Values

1.  **Resilience**: The browser must function without reliance on specific cloud providers or vendor accounts.
2.  **Openness**: The code is transparent, and the build process is accessible to anyone.
3.  **User Control**: Configuration defaults prioritize the user's agency over metrics or engagement.
